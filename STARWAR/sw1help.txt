Suicide Mission

1
The Rebel Alliance had little time to prepare for the Death Star's attack on the planet.
3
The Alliance studied the Death Star Blue Prints and found only one weakness in it's reactor exhaust.
3
Three waves of fighters attacked the Death Star and most were destroyed and now it's up to you destory it.

1
You start off at the beginning of the trench that protects you from most of the surface fire.
3
You will have to follow the trench through to the end where the vent it located in a wall.
3
When you get there you will have to fire torpedos that are controlled by an onboard computer.
3
As the vent is small; the torpedo may not travel down the vent but hit the lip. You will know this by
3
an explosion on the wall near the hole. You will know that have hit the vent when the vent turns yellow as the
3
emergency seal is broken and is exhausting radioactive material.

1
There are four types of enemy attacking defenders: Tie Fighters  Turbo Lazer Turrets  Torpedos and Surface Fire.
3
The Tie Fighters are fast and require accurate shooting to destroy. They fire rapidly. Each shot takes 10% off
3
of your sheild.
1
Turbo Lazer Turrets fire twin Ionising Field Weapons which will take 20% off of your shield if you are hit.
3
You can not destroy them!
1
Enemy Torpedos come in very fast. Each torpedo hit takes 10% off of your shield. The only way to destroy them is
3
by an Anti-Torpedo Blast.
1
If you stray too close to the top of the trench fire from hundreds of Surface Cannons can reduce your
3
Shield to nothing in a couple of seconds. Each hit takes 25% off of your shield.

You have a limited time to destroy the vent and if your engines are hit too much you might not be able to get
3
There in time!. Each time you are hit and your shield is down you will loose hull integrity which will damage vital
3
systems; Steering; Weapon; Engines; Shield Generator.
2
If There is too much damage to the steering you will not be able to steer!
2
If your engines are damaged too much you will stay stationary.

Each time your Shield Generator is hit it will take longer to get more shield.

The same will happen to your Quad Lazers

Bonuses will come occasionally and they will give you power ups. such as ; Heat seeking missiles; Immidiate Shield
3
Replacement. and Anit-Torpedo Blast.
