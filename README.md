# QB45
These are some ancient QB45 .bas files I pulled off old floppy discs that were in the bottom of my closet.

I didn't create any of these.  
I think they were all written in QB45, or original QBasic.  (They're almost the same.)
Some of them will work just fine in QB64.  Others will need to be updated.
It would be interesting to update these to be compatible in MMBasic or PicoMite's version of MMBasic.
